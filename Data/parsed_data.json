nodes.\n\nthis is what a came up with:\n\n\nconvert multiway tree to a trie, i.e. assign the following prefixes to every node in the above tree:\n\n\nthen, reserve a bit array for every possible prefix size and add the parent nodes to be tested against, i.e. if c is added to the potential parent node pool, do:\n\n\nwhen testing if a node is a descendant of a potential parent node, take its trie prefix, lookup the first character in the first \"prefix array\" (see above) and if it is present, lookup the second prefix character in the second \"prefix array\" and so on, i.e. testing f leads to:\n\n\n\nso yes f, is a descendant of c.\n\n\nthis test seems to be worst case o(n), where n = maximum prefix length = maximum tree depth, so its worst case is exactly equal to the obvious way of just going up the tree and comparing nodes. however, this performs much better if the tested node is near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node is somewhere at the top. combining both algorithms would mitigate both worst case scenarios. however, memory overhead is a concern.\n\nis there another way for doing that? any pointers greatly appreciated!\n", "tags": "algorithm tree

would allow us to set up separate development, testing, and staging environments - as well as allowing access to new operating systems that are requirements for systems or tools we are evaluating.   we re-purposed an existing workstation-class machine, threw in 24gb ram and raid-10, and were doing fine until we attempted to get the machine added to the domain.  \n\nnow we are beginning the war that all enterprise developers since the beginning of time have had to fight - the fight for local control of a development and testing environment.  the network and it admins' have raised concerns ranging from \"esx server is the enterprise standard\" to \"servers are not allowed on client vlans\" to \"[fill-in-the-blank] is not a skill set currently possessed in the local or enterprise it organization\".\n\nwe could justify production-class hardware and formal it support if we had to, but it would take time and involve a whole lot of headache.  even then it might take months to formally get it resources assigned by treating this as a production system - and even if we did, we would likely lose the local control we need.\n\ni imagine that many of you have had similar struggles over developer control of non-production environments - and virtualization in particular - so my questions are as follows:  \n\n\nwhat strategies and arguments have helped you win over the infrastructure (it &amp; network) folks to allow these types of silos to exist within enterprises which have standard network and security policies in place that would generally (and understandably) preclude this type of non-(centrally)-managed infrastructure?\nhave you found this to be a matter of technical justification - or more of a political struggle for control and ownership?\nif you ended up with a it-managed development environment, how much of a roadblock has it been for day-to-day development and testing?\nhas anyone ended up moving their development environment to a disconnected vlan or entirely separate network to avoid these network access struggles?\n\n\nalso, this is not a hyper-v vs. esx holy war (we would be fine with either - but hyper-v was selected since it is \"free\" with msdn for these purposes [yes, vmware has free tools too - but the good management tools generally aren't], and would be easier to manage by the local developers in a \"microsoft shop\") - so arguments for or against either are outside the scope of this question.\n\nthis is also less of a virtualization vs. physical hardware - i suppose the same question could be asked without the virtualization component to the equation.\n\nalso assume that the dev team has already made assurances to either manage patch management and antivirus, or integrate with the existing enterprise systems if they will support it.\nthis scenario, with different questions, is also posted on sf to hopefully elicit the opposing viewpoint.\n", "tags": ".net development-environment virtualization",

would it be individual words or entire phrases/sentences/paragraphs?\n\nthe real world data is about 15 fields including numbers, words, phrases, abbreviations, lists of words, and even paragraphs. they are for something like a library catalog of books and reports and less formal papers and documents.  some fields and examples follow:\n\nyear (e.g. 2010)\n\nseason (e.g. fall)\n\nfirst_name (e.g. william)\n\nlast_name (e.g. mcshane)  note: would be great to accomodate appostrophes but not necessary e.g. o'reilly, can't, smith-jenkins.\n\ntitle (e.g. the economic decline of blah blah regions)\n\ndescription (e.g. this text addresses a wide range of issues on ... )\n\nclassification (e.g. 4ab51-45)\n\nphone (e.g. 555-121-5444)\n\nemail (e.g. jkr@ppp.com\n\netc... \n\n2. in the design you're looking for, does keyword order still matter? for instance, if field1 = \"i ate a souffle made from lobster\", and i search for \"lobster souffle\", should it work?\n\ni'm not so concerned with word order or even phrases.  there will likely never be more than 20,000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results.  with one key word though it is impossible.  there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so i can't even search by year without getting a flood of results.  the query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords.  most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields.  so i might type (2010 economic airlines florida taxes) and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in florida or maybe florida showed up in another field e.g. a florida based airline, etc.\n\nsorry for the long winded response.  so, to answer the original question... if you search for \"lobster souffle\" is should find a record with a field1 entry of (i ate a souffle made from lobster).  similary if field one contains (lobster) and field2 contain (souffle) it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words.\n\nand now two design questions:\n\n3. will you ever add a field4, field5, field6, and so on in the future? the reason i'm asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate 'search' table or something like that. it's not 'normalised' (if you're not familiar with the term, normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places) but it does make things much more efficient. i can explain that a little more later if you want.\n\ni will almost certainly add / remove fields in the future.  i don't know what normalization is.\n\n4. i see you're stripping out all characters that aren't alphanumeric (or the space); will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes (like \"wasn't\" or \"o'ryan\"), hyphens, and so forth?\n\nas mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens.  i only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on youtube that i got the idea from.  i don't think any search phrases will include words like \"isn't\" but might include authors with appostrophes like o'reilly or hyphens like smith-galviston.  and there will be middle initials too like \"george p. scott\"\n", "tags": "php sql query search weighted", "id": "368", "title": "php code for multiple-keyword with weighted-results sql search"}, {"body": "i have a cmfcpropertygridctrl that i'm using in an options dialog box.  i have a method in my options dialog class called initpropertygrid().  this method clears any properties and populates the cmfcpropertygrid objects (using a custom settings object for the property values) and appends them to the grid. \n\nwhen i open my dialog box the first time all the properties show correctly.  however, if i then close my dialog box and reopen it, the very last property is not drawn on the screen.  all other properties are drawn normally:\n\nfirst time:\n\n\n\nall subsequent times:\n\n\n\nas you can see, the plus/minus icon is showing minus in both cases to indicated the section is expanded.  when the last item is not showing, clicking on the +/- icon once to contract and once to expand causes the last item to be correctly shown.\n\nnote when i close the dialog box, i do not destroy it but just reshow it.  however immediately before calling showwindow on the dialog i call the initpropertygrid() (called by updatetocurrentsettings) method.\n\n\n", "tags": "mfc mfc-feature-pack", "id": "369", "title": "cmfcpropertygridctrl last item not drawn?"}, {"body": "the demo looks simple,and it just animate one time when i click the button.\nthe question is:how can i change \"destination\" to \"source\" again?(it should have two sets of items)\n\njavascript:\n\n\n\nhtml:\n\n\n", "tags": "jquery quicksand", "id": "370", "title": "how to use jquery quicksand plugin in this way?"}, {"body": "i have a page that a user selects what he wants to download, the submit button posts the form to \n\n\n\nhowever, what if the model wasn't in a valid state?

list snippet, there is the phrase 'knowledge discovery' and therefore i would like to remove the single terms 'knowledge' and 'discovery', because they are also in the list and redundant in this context. i want to keep the phrases containing the single terms. i am also thinking about to remove all strings equal or less 3 characters. but that is just a thought for now.\n\nfor this cleanup process i would like to code a class using remove_if / find_if (using the new c++ lambdas) and it would be nice to have that code in a compact class.\n\ni am not really sure on how to solve this. the problem is that i first would have to identify what strings to remove, by probably setting a flag as an delete marker. that would mean i would have to pre-process that list. i would have to find the single terms and the phrases that contain one of those single terms. i think that is not an easy task to do and would need some advanced algorithm. using a suffix tree to identify substrings?

as showed in std::list erase incompatible iterator using the remove_if / find_if and the idea used in erasing multiple objects from a std::vector?.\n\nso the question is basically is there a smart way to do this and avoid multiple loops and how could i identify the single terms for deletion? maybe i am really missing something, but probably someone is out there and give me a good hint. \n\nthanks

\"third normal form\" of database design asks you to remove functional dependencies. it  seeks to eliminate redundancy, removing from a table any attributes (fields) that can be calculated from the other fields. for instance, when you make a reference to another entity, you only store its key. you don't store replicas of attributes from these referred entities, because that would mean having to update them every time you change the referred entity.\n\nanother situation is an attribute such as height. you want to know the height of a person, but in your application you may like to know it in different units: meters, feet, astronomical units. but you don't store all of these values, you should remove calculated fields, so you only leave one of them (meters, of course), and you calculate the transformed values \"on the fly\", when you need it.\n\nyou also don't store something like age, you calculate them from date of birth. in this case the fact that age changes with time also plays a role. if you don't do this your data will soon be incorrect, unless you keep updating it constantly.\n\nnow suppose you have a social network that displays the astrological sign of each user. for each user we display his or her sign, which is calculated from the date and time of birth, and also from the astrological tradition of the user's choice (e.g. western or chinese). calculating someone's sign is a pretty specialized and involved calculation, but is nevertheless something you can just call from an astrological library and calculate. how would you design this database, would you remove this functionally dependent attribute, or would you calculate the user's sign once, or every time she updates her date of birth, then store it in the database and forget about the possibility of calculating a sign in the rest of your system, or would you enforce the \"3nf\" rule with an iron fist? and how do you see the potential benefit of being able to tweak a user's sign if she insists that her sign should be different from the one that your algorithm is calculating?\n\nnow suppose a new application. you are building a system for the army, that chooses possible occupations for new conscripts. part of your system is a huge bad-ass pattern recognition machine, developed at ornl, that tells you what occupations will be allowed for the conscripts, based on a whole lot of data that comes from your database. this pattern recognition method looks at each person's height, date of birth, medical records, school transcript, and it also looks at a long list of answers the person gave to one of two questionnaires. it also takes in consideration evaluation questionnaires filled by higher-rank officers, and the analysis that is made looks at all of the conscripts from each year at the same time, to come up with a bunch of parameters for, say, a feed-forward neural network. this neural network is simpler than the whole of the pattern recognition system, but it is still a pretty involved calculation, not just a temperature unit conversion. nevertheless, you can see it as a \"black box\", and it can tell you the fate from each of your conscripts when you pull his record form the database.\n\nat a specific date in the army's calendar, the analysis is made, the ann parameters are found, and now you can run the black box and tell each conscript what he will be doing for the next one year or two. it's a pretty important thing. you will be deciding people's occupations, you will be sending some people to operate ovens at the kitchen, and other to drive tanks. everyone will be logging in the army's network to check out their occupations, and see the result in their personal webpages.\n\nnow, the little black box is there, and it outputs this important value based on the attributes pulled from your database. the attributes and parameters will probably never change, and the calculation of the conscript's destiny will probably be always correct, always the same value form the first day. but would you really leave that outside the database, just to follow the \"remove calculated attributes\" rule?\n\nthis is not just some calculation of age, astrological sign or temperature conversion. the pattern recognition system is indeed a path to calculate an attribute. but would you really like to keep that inside your system forever, re-calculating this hugely important thing over and over again? or would you consider it better to calculate everything once, and forget that this magical black box exists? i mean, just run all of this crazy pattern recognition code once some day, then pick the results, and record them in the database. when someone logs in to see the output from his analysis, make it so the query is just a boring data-fetching procedure, and leave all the pettern recognition \"excitement\" for another time.\n\nanother more palpable situation: you run a web store like amazon. you have a pattern recognition method to recommend books to people, that is fed from a user's record in your db. would you keep running the thing all the time you need the current recommendations, or would you treat the pattern recognition box as something separate from the rest of the system, just feeding its results to the database from where it can be read by other programs? wouldn't it be nice to have a control, for example, to make sure that you are not switching recommendations at an awkward moment?... don't worry too much about computational burden, assume excellent memory and computational resources.\n\ntl;dr -- do you think the rule of removing calculated attributes should never be broken, or would you say it is ok to store in the database the results from very important attributes, that are calculated by very complex and delicate pattern recognition methods? aren't there situations where we should just pretend that you actually cannot perform the calculation \"on demand\", and just leave recorded there these results, that won't be updated anyway?\n", "tags": "database-design attributes pattern-recognition maintainability robustness", "id": "728", "title": "should we always

are building a small/medium sized system that is anticipated to have a lifespan of 2-5 years (relatively short). the system is being developed with entity framework 4.1, code first, mvc3. we are trying to push our team towards unit testing / tdd. it is something that we have not done, but we recognize its value so are taking baby steps in that direction. \n\nwith all of that in mind, we have decided to build unit tests with visual studio 2010's built-in testing framework. we are not using the repository pattern or mocks. this is to reduce the complexity and time spent building the unit tests. each unit test is really more of an integration test - we have a 'test' database that gets initialized each time the tests are run, and each test uses the same controllers that the views use to get as close as we can to real-world behavior of the system.\n\nwhen commenting or answering this question, please do not attack this approach. i am well aware that this is not tdd in its purest form nor is it the ideal pattern for testing units of work. we are doing it this way to get our feet wet with the technology and try to get the most bang for our buck in terms of time spent building the unit tests.\n\nthe problem:\n\nwe are building a lot of unit tests that store an object via a controller, then retrieve the object from the database through the controller to verify that it was stored correctly and that it comes back through our controller the way we would expect. here is an example:\n\n\n\nthe error we are getting is this: \n\ntest method webobjects.tests.controllers.operatingcompanycontrollertest.edit_post_saves_operatingcompany_in_db_when_operatingcompany_is_valid threw exception: \nsystem.invalidoperationexception: an entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of ientitychangetracker.\n\ni am pretty sure this is occuring because the entity in question isn't being detached from the context of the first controller, and when we reinstantiate it and try to edit the same entity, it thinks another context still has ahold of it. the reason we are reinstantiating the controller is to ensure that the entity is being pulled back from the database and not just being returned from the cache of the dbcontext (please correct me if i am wrong here, but i believe that is what would be happening if we didn't reinstantiate).\n\nwe were able to get this to work by explicitly detaching every object from the context after every call to savechanges as well as detaching when we query objects via the context in our controllers, but i don't want to do that just to get our unit tests to work, plus i am sure it would be a significant performance hit. \n\nthe question:\n\nis there some better way to perform this type of integration test with our controllers?\n", "tags": "asp.net-mvc unit-testing asp.net-mvc-3 tdd ef-code-first", "id": "860", "title": "entity framework 4.1 integration unit tests"}, {"body":

of a web page (html\u00a0+ css\u00a0+ latin\u00a0modern fonts for web) and not of a tex document.  the web page is mostly paragraphs of text, but contains embedded png images (rendered tex snippets)

correctly, and it was done automatically.  i\u2019m calculating the baseline by first rendering a snippet consisting of only a \u201c.\u201d character, and then by measuring the height of the resulting image, after cropping away everything below the \u201c.\u201d, this tells me how much i need to lower the image (using css\u2019s  style) in order to align it with the surrounding text\u2019s baseline.  this works well for formulas that aren\u2019t too tall.\n\nwhere it fails is, well, taller formulas, as shown above. in the case of the first\u2014the larger\u2014square root formula, it needs to be lowered less than normal, because it extends higher than normal.  my calculations for this are currently wrong, and i\u2019m wondering how i can fix this.\n\nalternatives?\n\nwhat are some ways of measuring the baseline (in pixels) of a snippet?  i can\u2019t really use  for this because it crops the page as tightly as possible, which produces different image heights for , , and .  i\u2019m thinking i may need to render a calibration snippet consisting of two blank lines prior to a lone  (or perhaps a bottom-aligned horizontal rule) instead of just a single  character\u2014but that seems a bit kludgey.\n\nis there a way to coax tex into not placing a formula lower on the page when it is taller than standard text?  that is, is there some way i can cause a formula at the top of a page to protrude upward into the top margin?\n\na second problem\n\ni also noticed that i\u2019m seeing sub-pixel alignment problems.  below are screenshots

it's \u00bc pixel too high\u2014which means the problem lies within the image rather than the alignment value:\n\n\n\ni suspect this is fixable by making sure i round the image heights up to the nearest multiple of 4 before i downsample them for embedding in the page.  just wondering if anyone has tackled this problem before, and has any tips.  i\u2019m encouraged by these results so far, but

the jacobian, as it relates to the transformation of random variables. the nuts and bolts are buried in calculus however. \n\nnow, i have been reading this paper here, and i have some 'nested' questions so please bear with me. \n\nquestion 1) (page 1): it says that:\n\n\n  \"if h is differentiable, the approximation $h(x + dx) \\approx h(x) + h'(x)dx$\".\n\n\nwhy is this the case? i have 'accepted' it but i would like to know why its true, although it does not affect question (2) directly for me.\n\nquestion 2: (page 2): (this is my main question): towards the bottom, the author uses a, b, c and d as placeholders for partial derivatives. i am clear as to everything as to how he got there, up until where he puts the a,b,c and d into that mini table with the arrows. i am convinced that in the table, he has mixed up b with c. for example, he has written that:\n\n$$ \n(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \\rightarrow (y_1 + a, y_2 + b)\n$$\n\ni am conivinced that the 'b' should actually be a 'c', going by his own definition. so what i think it should read instead is:\n\n$$ \n(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \\rightarrow (y_1 + a, y_2 + c)\n$$\n\nmy reasoning is as follows. for the first part, ($y_1 + a$), we can get it as so:\n\n$$ h_1(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \\approx h_1(x_1,x_2) + \\frac{\\delta h_1(x_1,x_2)}{\\delta x_1} dx_1 + 0\n$$\n\nthis yields, by his own definition:\n\n$$\nh_1(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \\approx y_1 + a\n$$\n\nso far so good. so similarly, for the second coordinate of the transformed point, i reason as such:\n\n$$\nh_2(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \\approx h_2(x_1,x_2) + \\frac{\\delta h_2(x_1,x_2)}{\\delta x_1} dx_1 + 0\n$$\n\nso this then, by his own definitions, must be:\n\n$$\nh_2(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \\approx y_2 + c\n$$\n\nso why is it written as 'b' instead? b is as partial derivative of $h_1$ w.r.t $x_2$, whence in fact we are in actuality deriving $h_2$ w.r.t $x_1$. $x_1$ is the only thing that is varying, and the second coordinate of this point is a function of $h_2$. so what gives? is this a typo in the paper or have i missed something completely?\n\nsome context: i currently understand the random variable $y_1$ to be created as a linear combination of the r.v's $x_1$ and $x_2$, through transformation $h_1$. similarly, r.v $y_2$ is created as a linear combo of r.v's $x_1$ and $x_2$, through transformation $h_2$. \n\nthanks.\n", "tags": "matrices

have to adjust their draw method, for the correct transparency. but not only would this be annoying to have in every scene, with multiple kinds of transitions you'd get cluttered code pretty fast.\n\nso i've been thinking. the only way i could come up with to support this, and more complicated transitions, without handling it in the scene itself, are render targets for each scene. the render target would be set from the scene manager before calling the draw method. after draw the render target would get reset to the render target of the manager, and the scene's texture would get drawn with information about the current transition. without clearing the manager texture more scenes would follow, if more have to be drawn. this way you could do pretty much anything (transition wise), the scenes would be completely independent of each other, and you wouldn't need a single line of transition code in the actual scenes. (for reference, there are various transition types i'd like to be able to do. not only fades, but also shader effects, moving one scene in while the current one is \"pushed away\", etc., involving one or multiple scenes.)\n\nwell, that's my theory. here comes my question: does this sound like a viable plan?

actual http request by creating a backgroundworker and sending the work off to that to process. this was running fine on cutdown tests but when i applied the logic to the real code i found problems accessing session variables from the code running in the background worker. it seems that the httpcontext object that was passed has a null session and if i ask for httpcontext.current i get null back.\n\ni'm assuming that this is because they are in a different thread and that the session and httpcontext.current are both reliant on being in the same thread. is there any way i can get access to the session from the background worker or am i stuck with finding all the variables i need from session and putting them in an usable data structure and then putting them back in session (if appropriate) afterwards? it obviously complicates the refactor massively if i need to do this so i'd rather not.\n\nthanks for any thoughts you might have. i'm open to other suggestions on how i might

data from database a to database b through a wcf webservice (soap over http, a and b not on the same machine)\nif the data is successfully sent to database b, data is removed from database a\n\n\nplease note that this is a very simplified description of the problem i'm currently having. in my real application, i'm not replicating data between multiple sql server instances (see update at the end of the post).\n\neverything is part of a transaction, so the whole operation is atomic.\n\nhere's what i'm currently trying to do sequentially (everything in a transaction):\n\n\ni read a chunk from database a (say 50 rows)\ni update rows read in step 1 (i actually set the boolean  column of rows with the value , so in the future i know that these rows are sent)\ni consume (client side) a wcf webservice (soap 1.2, ) that is part of the transaction flow (blocking synchronous call). the webservice request sends the data read in step 1\nthe webservice implementation (server side) inserts data in database b (data that is contained in the webservice request)\n\nif no exception is received from the server, data with the  value as  are removed from database a\nif a specific  is received from the server, data with the  value as true are removed from database a\nfor other  and other exceptions (endpoint not found, or anything else), data with the  value as  are not removed from database a \n\n\n\nnote: there are actually multiple buffer databases (a1, a2, a3..., an) and multiple target databases (b1,.... bn). there are n threads to deal with n databases.\n\nif i run my server and my client, everything is working just fine. data is \"transferred\" atomically per chunks from database a to database b.\nwhen i brutally stop my client in the middle of the transaction (process killed), most of the time everything is fine (i.e. data is not removed from database a nor added to database b).\n\nbut sometimes (this is my actual problem), my database b becomes locked. the only option to unlock it is to terminate the server process.\n\nwhen the problem occurs, i can see in msdtc that there is an active transaction (note that in the screenshot there are 3 transactions as i'm currently dealing with 3 buffer databases and 3 target databases, but sometimes there is only 1 transaction even if there are 3 db).\n\n\n\ni see that database b is locked when trying to run a  againt database b. as you can see in the picture below, my  request is blocked by session id 67 which corresponds to an  in database b by the server process.\n\n\n\nthe lock remains forever (no transaction timeout, even after 1+ hour) until the server process is terminated. i can't validate or cancel the transaction in msdtc, i get a warning saying that \"\".\n\nwhy does the database b remained locked? if the client is terminated, shouldn't the transaction fail and the lock on database b be released after some timeout?\n\nhere's my code for server side:\n\n\n\nhere's my server side configuration (self-hosted wcf service):\n\n\n\nhere's my client code:\n\n\n\nhere's my client configuration:\n\n\n\nso my questions are:\n\n\nis my pattern/design with distributed transactions a valid and robust design?\nwhat could cause my database b to be locked for infinite time if my client's transaction is brutally terminated?\nwhat should i change (config and/or code and/or design) to make it work as expected (i.e. if my client process dies/crashes, i want the transaction to be aborted so the database b is not locked)?\n\n\nthanks.\n\n\n\nedit\n\ni do think i over-simplified the description of my actual use case. it looks like i'm actually doing a simple data replication between multiple sql server instances. that's not well explained (my bad), that's not what i'm trying to achieve.\n\ni'm not simply duplicating data. i read from a on machine m1 then write to b on machine m2, but what's written is not what i've read but some calculated value that comes from what was read.\ni'm pretty sure sql server replication services could handle business computation for me, but i can't go this way for some reasons:\n\n\ni can't use sql server replication because i'm actually not responsible of the server side (which writes to database b). i'm even not sure that there will be sql server on the other side (could be a java backoffice with mysql, postgresql or anything)\ni can't use sql server service broker or any message-oriented-middleware (which would fit imo) for same reason (potentially heterogeneous databases and environments)\ni can't change the webservices thing because the interface is now defined and fixed.\n\n\ni'm stuck by wcf, and i can't even change the binding configuration to use msmq or whatever because of interoperability requirements. msmq is great for sure (i'm already using it in another part of the project), but it's windows only. soap 1.2 is a standard protocol, and soap 1.2 transactions are standard too ( implementation).\n\nmaybe the wcf transaction thing is not a good idea, actually.\n\nif i have understood correctly how it actually works (please correct me if i'm wrong), it simply allows to \"continue\" the transaction scope on server side, which will require a transaction coordinator to be configured on server side, which probably breaks my interoperability needs (again, there could be a database on server side that does not integrate well with the transaction coordinator).\n", "tags": "c# sql-server wcf soap transactions", "id": "1897", "title": "sql server lock issue (distributed

to work,... sort of.\n\ni made a custom metabox for uploading and attaching images to posts, and it doesn't require you to use the horrible thickbox media uploader built into wp. i hate that thing. no, what i've done is just a group of inputs (title, description, file), which you can also duplicate, to add additional attachments if you want. so you fill in the fields, select an image to upload, and save draft or publish the post. once there are attachments added to a post, the metabox will display the input fields, along with a preview image of the attached image for each attachment you added. the title and description fields are used to generate the file meta data, nothing is saved as the post_meta, that i know of. that's currently all that i have gotten working so far.\n\ni need to make it so that when you save/publish a post, inturn upload/create the attachment files, it will create the three image sizes as the default wp uploader would, thumbnail, medium, large, and keeping the full size image too. if that's possible somehow. if not, i would like to otherwise use add_image_size() to create/define new custom sizes, and generate them that way instead, upon uploading. \n\ni'm not sure which function is the most ideal to use in this case, maybe the image_make_intermediate_size() function would be better, or wp_create_thumbnail() or wp_crop_image()... who knows!!\n\ni cannot figure out how to go about doing that, if i need to run the wp_handle_upload() function for each one, or maybe something involving the wp_generate_attachment_metadata() function. it's confusing to me since the 3 image sizes are to be associated as variants of the same attachment, and how to go about doing that. \n\ni have scoured the web, read the source of every wp media/upload/image related file, and played with just about every function there is for the media upload stuff and cannot find how wp creates the 3 image sizes anywhere, or how to do it myself.\n\nin wp-includes/media.php the image_resize() function looks like it would be best since it's exactly what it should be. i just can't figure out for the life of me what the hell i'm missing or have tried doing but did wrong to make the image thumbnails.\n\nhere's my working function that does the wp_handle_upload() stuff and things, but it also needs to create the 100px thumb, and make a resize version of the image that is max-width like 500px, and saved as new files of the uploaded one.\n\n\n\nanyone able to help me finally fix this so it works proper would be loved. i've spent so many ridiculous countless hours numerous different times trying to develop this thing and the documentation sucks, and there's not really any good posts anywhere on how to do it.\n\nthanks\n", "tags":

d_2$ and $d_2\\mid d_1$, then $d_1=d_2$\n\n\nalright this next one is probably just plain wrong but here goes.\n\n\n  let $a$ and $b$ be integers and let $n$ be a positive integer. prove that the\n  equation $ax \\equiv b \\pmod n$ has a solution if and only if $(a,n)$ divides\n  $b$. (the point here is that, we do not assume $(a,n) = 1$.)\n\n\nso what i did was:\n\n\nlet $d = \\gcd (a,n)$\nthen $d\\mid a$ by common sense so $a=dq_1$ where $q_1$ is an integer.\nwhich leads to $dq_1 x$ is congruent to $b$ where $q_1$ and $x$ are integers.\n$d\\mid(dq_1x)$ which is the left hand side of the equation thus it must also divide the right hand side\nthus  $d\\mid b$\nwhich leads to - if $\\gcd(a,n)$ does not divide $b$ there is no solution to the congruence. \n\n\nwhich is one if. other direction is \n\n\n$d\\mid b$ then $b = dw$ where $w$ is an integer. \nthen $d\\mid  ax$ or $d\\mid dq_1x$.\nthus we have a system $q_1x$ is congruent to $w$ where $x q_1$ and $w$ are integers and $\\gcd(q_1,n)=1$ \nso we apply the theorem in my text book that says a solution exists when that happens.\n\n", "tags": "homework abstract-algebra elementary-number-theory", "id": "2251", "title": "would love some criticism on a couple divisibility proofs"}, {"body": "i am new to jquery. i've done some simple things with it but what i am attempting now is a over my head and i need some help.\n\ni am building a locator for all the firearms dealers in the us for a client. i am working within drupal. i have a proximity search by zip-code that works great. if you search by zip a list of paginated results shows up in an html table that can by paged through via ajax.\n\ni would like a map to be above this list with markers corresponding to the names and addresses being listed. i already have all the lat and long values in the table results. i want the script to update the markers and automatically zoom to fit the markers in the view when a user changes the sort order of the table or pages through the results.\n\nalso, i'd like to have a hover highlight effect over the rows of the table that simultaneously highlight the corresponding marker, and have a click on the table row equal a click on a marker that pops up a marker info window to be populated using jquery to read the name and address fields of the table. hope this all makes sense.\n\ni know i'm putting a lot out there, i'm not asking for someone to write the whole script, just wanted to give as many details as possible. thanks for any help. i'm just lost when it comes to looping and moving data around.\n\nif you want to check out what i have so far on the project please visit: www.axtsweapons.com and login with the username: \"test\" and the password: \"1234\" and then visit this direct link: www.axtsweapons.com/ffllocator.\n\nfor just a simple page that would be easy to manipulate and play with go to: http://www.axtsweapons.com/maptest.html thanks!\n", "tags": "jquery-ajax google-maps-api-3 google-maps-markers", "id": "2252", "title": "need help writing jquery to loop through table and inject markers into google map?"}, {"body": "i am not sure whether the question title is proper or not, but after searching a lot i am asking this.\n\nin my sqlite table, i have the columns\n\n\n\nhow would i get the image from the path and set into the gridview\n\n\n\nafter this what should i do?\n", "tags": "android sqlite cursor", "id": "2253", "title": "how to use cursoradapter?"}, {"body": "can anyone please suggest a method (ruby, python or dos preferable) to remove only the different files and sub-folders between two given folders?\n\ni need it to recurse through sub-directories and delete everything that is different.\n\ni don't wanna have to install anything, so a script would be great.\n\nthanks in advance\n", "tags": "python ruby dos ms-dos", "id": "2254", "title": "remove differences between two folders"}, {"body": "in rails i have an order form model using simple_form and zurb. i have limited customers to 6 fields where they can enter a product title themeselves as a string. i then add up the product titles and charge them manually. i'd like for the user to add their own fields or add additional fields, each field representing $15 dollars; besides the initial field, that should represent $35. i plan on taking that total and integrating activemerchant, which i found some material on. but i can't seem to figure out this part!

application written in c# that leans against an mssql database. windows sharepoint services 3.0 is installed (default installation, single processor, default sql express content database and so on) on the same windows server 2003 machine.\n\nscenario:\nthe application generates ms word documents during processing (creating work orders) that need to be saved on sharepoint, and the result of the process must be linked to the corresponding document.\nso, for each insert in dbo.workorders (one work order), there is one ms word document. i would need to save the document id from the sharepoint library to my database so that later on, possible manual corrections can be made to the document related. when a work order is deleted, the sharepoint document would also have to be deleted.\nalso, there is a dbo.jobs table which is parent to dbo.workorders and can have several work orders.\n\ni was thinking about making a custom list on sharepoint, that would have two id fields - one is the documents id and the other autoid of the document. i don't think this would be a good way performance-wise and it requires too much upkeep, therefore it's more error prone.\n\nanother path i was contemplating is metadata. i could have an identity field in dbo.workorders that would be unique and auto incremented, and i could save that value as a file name (1.docx, 2.docx 3.docx ... n.docx where n would be the value in dbo.workorder's identity field). in the metadata field of the word document, i could save the job id from dbo.jobs.\n\ni could also just increment the identity field in the workorder (it would be a bigint), but then the file names would get ugly and maybe i'd overflow the id range (since there could be a lot of documents).\n\nthere are other options also that i have considered and dismissed, since none of them satisfied the requirements (linked data sources, subfolder structures etc.). i'm not sure how to proceed. i'm new to sharepoint and it's still a bit of a

is that sometimes the user beats the server to its initial save and we end up saving two objects.\n\nan example of how to recreate this problem is as follows:\n\n\nuser clicks the add person button, we add this to the dom but don't save anything yet as we don't have any data yet.\n\n\nuser enters a value into the name field, and tabs out of it (name field loses focus). this triggers a save so that we update the model on the server. as the model is new, backbone.js will automatically issue a post (create) request to the server.\n\n\n\n\nuser then very quickly types into the age field they have tabbed into, enters 20 and tabs to the next field (age therefore loses focus). this again triggers a save so that we update the model on the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso we would expect in this scenario one post request to create the model, and one put requests to update the model.\n\nhowever, if the first request is still being processed and we have not had a response before the code in point 3 above has run, then what we actually get is two post requests and thus two objects created instead of one.\n\nso my question is whether there is some best practice way of dealing with this problem and backbone.js? or, should backbone.js have a queuing system for save actions so that one request is not sent until the previous request on that object has succeeded/failed? or, alternatively should i build something to handle this gracefully by either sending only one create request instead of multiple update requests, perhaps use throttling of some sort, or check if the backbone model is in the middle of a request and wait until that request is completed.\n\nyour advice on how to deal with this issue would be appreciated.\n\nand i'm happy to take a stab at implementing some sort of

advices, one in particular points me to google's app engine, so i downloaded it and ran the demo guestbook while my ipn servlet is still running on netbeans, the strange thing happened, after i entered \"appengine-java-sdk-1.3.2\\bin\\dev_appserver.cmd appengine-java-sdk-1.3.2\\demos\\guestbook\\war\" from the command prompt, i went to the following url on my browser \"http://localhost:8080/\", i thought i would see the google demo guestbook page, no, what i saw was another servlet i developed 2 years ago : \"web academy\", online course registration app. \n\nhow can that happen? i never started it, and i haven't touch that project for years. i guess because it's also listening on port 8080, so now i understand why the ipn messages only came through 1 in 10 times, because another servlet was also listening on that port and could have got the messages intended for ipn, or some how those two servlets' processes mixed up and therefore couldn't respond to paypal properly, and failed. in order to verify some of my guesses.\n\ni turn off netbeans, and ran the google guestbook again at the prompt, this time on my browser http://localhost:8080/ points to

\u201ctb_movies\u201d and a junction table \u201ctb_movies_actors\u201d. the ef designer creates  two entities \"actors\" und \"movies\" and sets their navigation properties based on the foreign keys correctly. so was able to come up with a view which binds to a viewmodels property which has all \u201cmovies.actors\u201d. \n\nthe datagrid in my view displays all actors correctly, and \u2013 if it\u2019s a new actor which isn\u2019t in my db already- i am able to add new actors to a movie and persist the changes to the db correctly.\n\nhowever, if i want to add an actor to a movie who is already in my db, i\u2019ll get a double entry in my tb_actors table. first i\u2019ve set the primary key fields (name and id) to unique, but then my code breaks. then, i\u2019ve added a little update routine which checks for each related actor of a movie if it\u2019s a known actor, and changes the \u201cnew actors\u201d id to the \u201cold actors\u201d id \u2013 this also breaks.\n\nis there a way to tell ef that it has to determine if an added related object (= already known actor added to movie) is already in the db, and it therefore has to insert only a new entry to to junction table, but not to the related objects table?\n\nmy next step would be detaching the related objects and do all updates/inserts in my own data access code \u2026 but since i believe my problem is around a typical

\\vec{v_0} \\| &lt; \\delta $ then $f(\\vec{v}) &lt; 0$. \n\nmy argument was simply to use the statement of continuity at $\\vec{v_0}$ to prove this. that is, since $f$ is continuous, the following holds:\n\n$$ \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0 \\quad \\exists \\delta &gt; 0 : \\quad \\| \\vec{v} - \\vec{v_0} \\| &lt; \\delta \\rightarrow \\| f(\\vec{v}) - f(\\vec{v_0}) \\| &lt; \\epsilon .$$\n\nso, as referred to above, we must have $\\delta = \\delta(\\epsilon)$. then we can make the replacement $\\delta = \\delta(|a|)$, and we have the necessary $\\delta$ to prove that $f(\\vec{v}) &lt; 0$.\n\ni have one main question (the one that closes this), and one side question.\n\n\nunder what conditions can we assume that $\\forall x \\exists y : r(x, y)$, then $y = y(x)$?\n\nare there indirect ways to prove a proposition of the form $\\forall x \\exists y : r(x, y)$ where $y$ is somehow not dependent on $x$ and also not a constant? perhaps it varies on $r$, but that is given, i suppose. certainly all $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ proofs that i've come across have been constructive in this way.\nis there a canonical way to prove the proposition above?\n\ni actually struggled with a possible proof for a while before i came up with the technique above. i used this technique in a hw assignment and on my latest advanced calculus test. the hw was marked as correct although with the note that it was \"indirect\", while the test was marked as wrong. granted, the hw was done by the ta, the test by my prof. i personally don't see a more \"direct\" way to prove this result.\n\n", "tags": "real-analysis soft-question logic proof-strategy", "id": "2456", "title": "is it true that for all proofs of the statement, $\\forall x \\exists y : r(x, y)$, then we can say $y = y(x)$?

is great and seems to generally find very good clusters for my data.\n\nthe problem is that i don't really know r at all, and while i have managed to muddle through the clustering process based on the help() contents and the extensive readme, i cannot for the life of me figure out how to write out the actual cluster results to file.  i am using the following absurdly simple script to perform the clustering,\n\n\n\nat which point i have cluster results and a summary.  the data in data.csv is just a list of multi-dimensional points, one per line.  so each line looks like 'x,y,z' (in the case of 3 dimensions).\n\nif i use 2d points (e.g. just the x and y vals) i can then use the internal plot function to get a very pretty graph that plots the original points and color codes each point based on the cluster it was assigned to.  so i know all the info is somewhere in 'mybic', but the docs and help don't seem to provide any insight as to how to print out this data!\n\ni want to print out a new file based on the results i believe are encoded in mybic.  something like,\n\n\n\nand then - hopefully - also print out the parameters/centroids of the individual gaussians/clusters that the clustering process found.\n\nsurely this is an absurdly easy thing to do and i'm just too ignorant of r to figure it out... \n\nedit:  i seem to have gotten a little bit further along.  doing the following prints out a somewhat cryptic matrix,\n\n\n\nwhich upon reflection i realized is actually the list of samples and their classifications. i guess it is not possible to write this directly via the write command, but a bit more experimentation in the r console lead me to realize that i can do this:\n\n\n\nand that the result actually looks pretty nice!\n\n\n\nwhere the first column apparenly matches the index for the input data, and the second column describes the assigned class identity.\n\nthe 'mysummary$parameters' object appears to be nested though, and has a bunch of sub-objects corresponding to the individual gaussians and their parameters, etc.  the 'write' function fails when i try to just write it out, but individually writing out each sub object name is a bit tedious.  which leads me to a new question: how do i iterate over a nested object in r and print the elements out in a serial fashion to a file descriptor?  \n\ni have this 'mysummary$parameters' object.  it is composed of several sub-objects like 'mysummary$parameters$variance$sigma', etc.  i would like to just iterate over everything and print it all to file in the same way that this is done to the cli

the issue is with the wait events in .net only, and mostly only when \"other stuff\" is happening on the test pc -- but not a lot of stuff, can be as simple as moving a window around, or opening a folder in my computer.\n\nmaybe .net events are just really bad about context switching, or .net apps/threads in general?  in the app i'm using to test my .net code, the code just runs in the constructor of a form (easy place to add test code), not on a thread-pool thread or anything.\n\ni also tried using the version of waveoutopen that takes an event instead of a function callback.  this

the screen area needed to repaint when the background is stationary and only the sprites move.\n\nthe above approach only works when the background doesn't change (and hence most of the screen pixels remain stationary).\n\nvertical scrolling games, like old school shoot'em ups, have the thing a bit more difficult with the background changing every frame due to the scroll. however, one could take advantage of the way pixels are fed to the display (line-by-line). i imagine that one could use a bigger buffer and shift the data pointer some lines \"down\" every frame, so that it will be redrawn starting from another position, thus giving the impression of a smooth scroll. still only sprites (and a bit of the background at the edge of the screen) would need to be redrawn, which is a serious optimisation.\n\nhowever, for side scrolling games, the thing is not that simple and obvious. still, i'm aware that somebody, somewhere in the past, has though of an optimisation which (with some limitations) allowed the old machines to scroll the background horizontally without redrawing it every frame.\n\niirc it was used in many old games, mostly 80's beat'em ups, as well as in demoscene

\\frac{1}{2}d(x_{n+1},x_{n})$$\n  \n  for all $n \\geq 1$\n  \n  then $(x_n)$ is cauchy. to show this, \ufb01rst note that by assumption we have\n  \n  $$d(x_{n},x_{n-1}) \\leq \\frac{1}{2^{n-2}} d(x_2,x_1)$$\n  \n  so that if $n &gt; m$ we have\n  \n  $$d(x_m , x_n) \\leq d(x_m,x_{m+1}) + \\cdots + d(x_{n-1},x_{n})$$\n  $$\\leq d(x_1 , x_2) \\cdot \\left [ \\frac{1}{2^{m-1}} + \\cdots +

the scrollbar handle. the idea is that if i drag the handle 3/4 of the way down on the physical screen, i'd be 3/4 of the way down on the page.\n\ntthe dropbox iphone app (it's great, btw!) has exactly this kind of scrollbar for long pdf documents. regular scrolling is done by dragging anywhere but on the handle; dragging the handle moves the view to that location. this seems to have been implemented \"from scratch\", as i don't think the sdk is flexible enough to customize the behavior of the existing scrollbar.\n\nhowever, dropbox uses the native document viewers to show documents on the iphone, so somehow they add the scrollbar functionality to it. see the scrollbar handle? you can drag that to quickly get somewhere else in the document.\n\n\n\n\nthis concept is very similar to how index bars work in uitableview (ie. contacts.app); the index appears as a bar on the right hand side of the table (for example, \"a\" through \"z\"), and you can touch a particular label to jump to the target section. in this case, however, a very long page doesn't have sections, and it should work for general-purpose scrolling, not jumping to sections.\n\nso how can i go about implementing

it seems to me, for this theory to hold, we would have to only call those @stateful beans from jsf @managedbean with @sessionscope, or directly from a xhtml page, having first marked the @stateful with @named. does this really make sense ?\n\ni might also add that this scope (@sessionscoped) on @managedbeans feels extremely redundant to me, we haven't used it once in the project for said web-application, but rely solely on @managedbean with @requestscoped or @viewscoped annotations.\n\ni guess what i am really asking here is, does it really hold true that we should never inject @stateful beans into @stateless ones ?

(i've found this much more convenient in creating styles).\n\nfor example specifying a common style rule for all landscape objects in the js api:\n\n\n\nthis would amount to the below for the static map api:\n\n\n\nstill the static map will return an image where both landscape and manmade layers are differentiated in colors:\n\n\n\nhas this happened to anyone before? any idea on how to address it?\ni've tried specifying both landscape.manmade and landscape.natural with the same exact values but it didnt work. i also tried turning visibility off on landscape.man_made but it failed too.\n\nthanks in advance for your help!\n", "tags": "google-maps google-static-maps", "id": "3513", "title": "google static maps api -- behaves differently than styled maps api"}, {"body": "i'm currently working with the vmrun-tool, to control vmware virtual machines.\ni'm using vmwareworkstation 7.0.0/7.0.1 and vmwareplayer 3.0.0 on windows 7 x64.\n\ni simply want to take a screenshot of each virtual machine which is powered on.\n\nlisting the power-on virtual machines is quite simply and works!\n(vmrun list)\n\nbut the capturescreen command doesn't work.\ni have tryed serveral commandline options.\n\nfor example:\nvmrun -t ws capturescreen %vmpath% %outputpath%\ni get no error message, but the console is blocked (and the command never finishes).\n\ni have also tryed to include -gu username and -gp password, but it result in the same problem.\n\nsorry for my english and thanks for your help in advance!!!\n", "tags": "vmware vmware-workstation", "id": "3514", "title": "how to make screenshots using vmware tool \"vmrun\"?"}, {"body": "i'd like to have a custom registration confirmation page live within a wordpress site. i can provide a url for this page to an external site. when the registration is successful the url has several parameters, one of which is 'name' (which of course is a reserved word in wordpress) and a 404/page not found results.\n\nthe url (get variables are coming from an external site, so i have no control over them) is something like: \n\n\n\nwhat is the best way to handle such a situation? i'd like to be able to use the 'name' value in the page, so i don't want to just discard.\n\nthanks for any suggestions.\n", "tags": "php url-rewriting urls", "id": "3515", "title": "how to deal with a get variable of 'name'?"}, {"body": "there's a number of times in the past couple of months where i've developed code for a feature, committed the feature to the git repository and then at some later date decided to remove some of those features. what i end up having to do in order to keep the code base clean is delete a file or parts of files that were committed to git and commit those changes.\n\nhowever, in the interest of having the deleted code easily reinstated at a later date, i go through an additional step of cloning the repository elsewhere, checking out the commit prior to the delete, copying over the files that were changed (using ditto or even manually sometimes) and then committing the changes to a new branch. this additional step gives me ability to have the deleted feature abstracted in a branch and reinstate the feature into the codebase quite easily at a later stage by merging the branch. \n\nis this a common practice and more importantly am i missing a git feature that allows me to do this out of the box. if so, what is command to achieve this?\n", "tags": "git", "id": "3516", "title": "moving deletions to a branch in git"}, {"body": "i'm trying to write code in kineticjs to move unit represented by a group which contains its sprite (it's a group since i might want to add more things to the graphical representation).\n\nthe code for the movement function is:\n\n\n\nwithout the line \"sprite.setanimation('idle');\" everything works well. with this line everything still works as expected most of the time (i.e. the animation stops after the movement has ended) but sometimes the sprite disappears altogether and i get the following cryptic error message: \"error: d is undefined\" in line 29 in kinetic-v3.9.8.min.js\n\nfor the purpose of testing, right now moveto is called by clicking on the mouse on the screen. i thought it might have something to do with me clicking the mouse before the previous movement is over, but sometimes the error occurs even when i'm careful not to do it.\n\nedit: the error occurs most of the time when i click near the edge of the stage and the movement order orders the unit \"out\" of it. still, nothing bad happens unless i change the sprite animation and i don't understand the connection. also, i managed to reproduce the error without clicking anywhere near the border, it's only more rare.\n", "tags": "kineticjs", "id": "3517", "title": "kineticjs -

managed to make the object move incrementally instead of teleporting and was able to eliminate my tween.  without a tween, collision detection was working properly.  but i still have some issues.  first, how do i get gravity/friction to apply to the ball so that it doesn't come to a stop in a non-collision (or scoring) area when it otherwise runs out of steam?  two, how can i make it collide properly with the boundaries so it reverses course at a proper rate?  and three, slightly unrelated but still a major challenge so i'll mention it now:  if my collision areas (scoring targets) are aligned vertically, can i put conditions in the collision detection to test for rate of speed to effectively collide with a target?  how can i determine that rate of speed?\n\nok, here's my current

drawgame function to create the game table.\n\n\n\nand the list of my related global vars:\n\n\n\n\n\nok, i've sorta fixed it, but it is still messy visually.  the ball will now move backwards.  i've meant to put in a condition where the ball will be removed when it reaches a threshold which represents the gutter on the table; however, flash doesn't seem to run the condition statement soon enough to catch the ball before it has moved visually beyond the y value.  it does remove the ball, but it looks ugly as the ball has rolled back onto the lane before it disappears.  how can i get condition checking times sped up?\n\nhere's my modified code.  pointers are appreciated. \n\n\n\n\n\nok, i wanted to put an update in here.  i basically \"solved\" my rollbackwards timing issues by adjusting the y coordinate.  i either measured wrong, or got my orientation in opposition to the direction i was meant to be moving.  it mostly works now.\n\n\n\nwhat is still a little ugly looking is when/where the ball is removed after making collision with a target.  my, perhaps, awkward conditional chain of coordinate calculations largely works from an effectiveness pov, but the ball always seems to be removed several pixels(?) prior to the actual collision being measures - even accounting for bounding boxes as opposed to actual shapes.  i also attempted to turn the ball into a tween just before it was removed to make it fade away in a pretty manor, but that never seemed to work.  and i never even tried to tackle turning the arc-shaped \"bumpers\" under each target into actual collision objects that the ball could roll along if the aim was off.  that was just put into the \"too hard\" basket.  below is my code for the collision measuring and the tweening, just in case anyone has any keen insights to add.  otherwise, i'm relatively happy with the end result.\n\n\n\ni considered some \"efficiency\" measures in the long function above, but i couldn't quite get the

that uses session.sessionid to prevent multiple users viewing the same data at the same time.\n\ni have a table that contains a set of images (stored in blob) that require processing.  only one user

readerwriterlock.\n\ni have done a test to ensure the readerwriterlock is working correctly and can confirm that only one session can execute the code inside that block at once.\n\nmy current theory is that two different users are getting the same sessionid at the same time.  a user of this application is allowed to view records they have locked or any unlocked images.\n\ni have modified the application to display the sessionid in the footer of every page so that if the problem happens again i can check the sessionid value.\n\ni've seen some articles online suggesting that sessionid is not unique and some saying that the sessionid is unique.  i understand that sessionid is not unique forever but can the sessionid value be considered unique for active sessions?\n\nthis forum describes a similar problem\n\ni have also read some suggestions that a guid should be stored in the session object and used as a unique id instead of the session id.\n\nthanks for the responses so far.  here is a clarification based on the answers so far:\n\n\"locked forever\" - we prevent this by a lock timeout of 5 minutes.  before a user locks an image, while inside the readerwriterlock, we do a \"cleanup\" of old locks (which unlocks images locked for more than 5 minutes), a query to get the oldest unlocked image and an update statement to \"lock\" that image to the current session.\n\na possible cause of the problem would be if one user \"locks\" an image but then leaves the pc for a short break.  if they did nothing for 5 minutes, that image on there screen would be unlocked and potentially opened by another user.  i mentioned this scenario when the problem was reported and i was assured that the users had been working continuously.\n\n\"different window/tab\" - i haven't actually seen the error with my own eyes but the person who reported the problem has told me that it is two different pc's and two different usernames of the logged in user.\n\nhopefully now that i am displaying the session id on the page, next time it happens i will be able to say with certainty whether it is the same session id on two machines or if it is some other problem.  this issue has never occurred during the testing phase so it appears to be a symptom of a larger number of concurrent users.\n\nthanks for the responses so far and i will update this question as more information comes to hand.\n\nit seems that the user didn't give me the full story.  session id is unique in our case as per the accepted answer.  two users were able to see the same image at the same time because user 1 was idle for the 5 minute \"abandoned image\" unlock process.  the \"abandoned image\" timeout has been raised to match the session timeout to avoid this problem.\n", "tags": "asp.net

it seems to me the first set makes more sense as i can attach physical meaning to each and every x and y in there, while i find no physical meaning in  x' = x / z  and  y' = y / z  when the camera focal length is not exactly 1. furthermore, one cannot compute  x'  and  y'  for we don't know  (x, y, z).\n\n(3) unfortunately, things get even murkier when we refer to the writings in intel's open source computer vision library reference manual's section lens distortion (page 6-4), which states in part:\n\n\"let  ( u, v )  be true pixel image coordinates, that is, coordinates with ideal projection, and  ( u \u0303, v \u0303 )  be corresponding real observed (distorted) image coordinates. similarly,  ( x, y )  are ideal (distortion-free) and  ( x \u0303, y \u0303 )  are real (distorted) image physical coordinates. taking into account two expansion terms gives the following:\n\n\n\nwhere r = sqrt( x^2 + y^2 ). ...\n\n\"because   u \u0303  =  cx + fx * u   and   v \u0303 = cy + fy * v ,  \u2026  the resultant system can be rewritten as follows:\n\n\n\nthe latter relations are used to undistort images from the camera.\"\n\nwell, it would appear that the expressions involving  x \u0303  and  y \u0303  coincided with the two expressions given at the top of this writing involving  xcorrected  and  ycorrected. however,  x \u0303  and  y \u0303  do not refer to corrected coordinates, according to the given description. i don't understand the distinction between the meaning of the coordinates  ( x \u0303, y \u0303 )  and ( u \u0303, v \u0303 ), or for that matter, between the pairs ( x, y ) and ( u, v ). from their descriptions it appears their only distinction is that  ( x \u0303, y \u0303 )  and  ( x, y )  refer to 'physical' coordinates while  ( u \u0303, v \u0303 )  and  ( u, v )  do not. what is this distinction all about?
